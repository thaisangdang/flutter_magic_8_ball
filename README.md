# Magic 8 Ball (Flutter)

A fun decision-making app based on the classic toy. This project acts as a "confidence builder," reinforcing the concepts of **State** and **Randomness** while introducing a simpler, centered layout.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By building this project, you will learn:
- **Consolidation:** Reinforcing the use of `StatefulWidget` and `setState`.
- **Layouts:** Using the `Center` widget effectively for single-element designs.
- **Assets:** Managing and swapping multiple image assets dynamically.
- **Logic:** Mapping random integers (1-5) to specific asset filenames.

## 📱 Features
- **Tap to Predict:** Click the ball to reveal a new answer.
- **Randomized Answers:** 5 different responses (Yes, No, Ask Again Later, etc.).
- **Clean UI:** A minimalist, distraction-free interface using deep blue themes.
